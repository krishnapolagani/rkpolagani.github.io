      <h2>Where It All Started</h2>
      <p>
        After graduating in 2011, I joined Mahindra Satyam in India. Like many fresh graduates, I stepped in with a mix
        of excitement and uncertainty. I was trained as a Java developer and soon placed on a project for a major
        high-tech customer. My assignment sounded straightforward on paper: convert manual test scripts into automation
        using Selenium.
      </p>
      <p>
        Those early days were about learning the basics — frameworks, test design, debugging, and understanding how a
        large enterprise application behaves under real user scenarios. But very quickly, something else started to
        catch my attention.
      </p>
      <p>
        The application I was testing and automating was called <strong>Oracle Agile PLM</strong>. At first, it was just
        “the system under test.” Over time, my curiosity moved from “how do I automate this step?” to
        “why does this step exist at all?” and “what process is this screen part of?”. That’s where PLM really entered my story.
      </p>

      <h2>Understanding What PLM Really Is</h2>
      <p>
        As I explored Agile PLM, I started to understand what Product Lifecycle Management actually means in practice.
        Every product around us — the keyboard I’m typing on, your phone, your laptop, even medical devices and
        industrial equipment — moves through a lifecycle: concept, design, development, validation, manufacturing,
        changes, service, and eventually end-of-life.
      </p>
      <p>
        PLM sits in the middle of all of that. It connects engineering, manufacturing, quality, regulatory, suppliers,
        and even IT into one consistent view of the product. Once that clicked, it stopped feeling like “just another
        enterprise tool” and started to look like the <strong>heart of how companies build and manage products</strong>.
      </p>

      <h2>Diving Deeper Into PLM</h2>
      <p>
        As my understanding grew, my role naturally evolved. I wasn’t only thinking about test cases and automation
        coverage anymore. I was looking at lifecycles, workflows, data models, engineering change orders, and how
        different teams used the same data in different ways.
      </p>
      <p>
        I began working more closely with functional consultants and business users, sitting in on discussions about
        change processes, approvals, and compliance. That shift — from “how to test the system” to
        “how the system supports real business processes” — is what firmly pulled me into the PLM domain.
      </p>

      <h2>Growing in India (2011–2019)</h2>
      <p>
        For several years, I continued to work in India across different projects, customers, and industries. PLM gave
        me exposure to high-tech, industrial, medical device, and semiconductor environments. Each customer used their
        PLM system slightly differently, and every engagement taught me something new:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>how engineering and manufacturing teams think about the same product in different ways,</li>
        <li>how change management can either slow a company down or protect it from big mistakes,</li>
        <li>and how critical clean, reliable product data is for day-to-day decisions.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        During this phase, I moved beyond testing into configuration, enhancements, and solutioning. I worked on
        change workflows, BOM structures, user roles, integrations, and performance issues. It was a good mix of
        technical and functional work — exactly the balance that still keeps me interested in PLM today.
      </p>

      <h2>Working Across Multiple PLM Systems</h2>
      <p>
        Over time, I was fortunate to work hands-on with multiple PLM and PDM platforms, each bringing a slightly
        different lens:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Oracle Agile PLM</strong> — my foundation and entry point into PLM.</li>
        <li><strong>Siemens Teamcenter</strong> — deep engineering structures, integrations, and enterprise scale.</li>
        <li><strong>PTC Windchill</strong> — strong CAD and product structure management with rich engineering context.</li>
        <li><strong>MechWorks PDM</strong> — a fast, CAD-centric PDM that showed how design teams work day-to-day.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Each system taught me something different — how CAD connects to PLM, how BOMs evolve, how workflows scale,
        how integrations shape the digital thread, and how users interact with product data every single day.
      </p>

      <h2>PLM vs PDM — A Quick Thought</h2>
      <p>
        Over the years, one simple way I’ve come to think about it is:
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>PDM manages engineering files.</strong><br>
        <strong>PLM manages everything that happens before and after engineering.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Working in both environments helped me see the entire product data journey — from the first CAD model to the
        released BOM, to changes triggered by quality issues or customer feedback.
      </p>

      <h2>PLM Opened Doors Beyond India</h2>
      <p>
        Around 2019, PLM didn’t just remain a domain I worked in — it became the reason I started travelling for work.
        My experience with Agile PLM, Teamcenter, integrations, and process consulting created opportunities to work
        with global teams and customers.
      </p>
      <p>
        What started as projects in India gradually expanded into onsite engagements and international roles. Working
        with teams across time zones and cultures changed how I communicated, how I documented solutions, and how I
        approached stakeholder expectations. PLM became the common language that connected all of these experiences.
      </p>

      <h2>Canada Eventually Became Home</h2>
      <p>
        Over time, those international opportunities led me to Canada. What began as “a new assignment in a new
        country” slowly turned into something more permanent. I found myself working with cross-functional teams again
        — engineering, manufacturing, quality, IT — but now in a different context, with new products and new
        regulations.
      </p>
      <p>
        The domain stayed the same: PLM, integrations, change management, product data. The surroundings changed:
        new cities, seasons, people, and ways of working. Somewhere along the way, Canada stopped feeling like a
        temporary location and started feeling like home.
      </p>

      <h2>Why I Stayed in PLM</h2>
      <p>
        Looking back, a simple test automation project in 2011 quietly set the direction for my entire career. Even
        after changing companies, roles, industries, and countries, one thing has stayed constant:
        <strong>I never left the PLM world.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        PLM is where engineering, systems thinking, process design, and user experience meet. Every implementation is a
        little different. Every company has its own way of managing products. And every project tells a story about how
        ideas turn into real things that people use.
      </p>
      <p>
        That mix of complexity, impact, and continuous learning is what keeps me in this domain — and it’s why I’m still
        excited to work on PLM, all these years later.
