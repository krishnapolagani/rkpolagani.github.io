          A journey that started in 2017 with a solo trip to Leh Ladakh — and hasn’t really stopped.
        </p>
        <p>
          Travel has helped me connect perspectives across regions, cultures, and ways of living.
          It balances my professional life in PLM and systems with moments of simplicity on the road:
          mountains, local food, conversations with strangers, and long days on a bike or in a bus.
        </p>
        <p>
          This page is a growing log of some of those journeys, starting with the first one that
          changed everything for me: a solo trip from Hyderabad to Leh Ladakh in 2017.

            <h3>2017 – Leh Ladakh: First Solo Journey</h3>
            <div class="item-meta">Leh &amp; Ladakh, India · 2017</div>
            <p>
              My travel story really began in 2017, when I took a solo trip from Hyderabad to Leh Ladakh.
              Coming from South India, it felt like stepping into a completely different world  cold weather,
              high altitude, new food, and a culture that was different but incredibly warm and welcoming.
            </p>
            <p>
              During the trip I met travellers from across India and abroad. Even though I started alone,
              it never really felt like a “solo” journey  conversations at small cafes, shared taxis, and
              long bus rides turned strangers into temporary travel companions.
            </p>
            <p>
              The highlight was a bike ride from Leh to Pangong Lake, crossing one of the highest motorable
              passes in the world. The combination of winding mountain roads, silence, and open landscapes
              is something you don’t forget easily.
            </p>
            <p>
              That journey gave me confidence to step out of my comfort zone, trust myself in unfamiliar
              situations, and appreciate how different parts of the country live and think. It’s still the
              trip I look back to whenever I think about “why I travel”.

            <p>
              Since that first trip, I’ve continued exploring new places  from different parts of India
              to my current life in Canada. I’ll keep adding more stories, photos, and reflections here as
              I document them properly instead of just keeping them in my phone gallery.
