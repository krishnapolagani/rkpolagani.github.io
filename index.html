            I help engineering, manufacturing, quality and IT teams connect their product data,
            from early design all the way to manufacturing and change. My focus is on building
            a reliable digital thread across PLM, ERP, ALM, MES and QMS so decisions are based
            on clean, consistent and traceable information.
          </p>
          <p>
            This site is also a personal sandbox where I experiment with clean layouts using
            simple HTML, CSS and a bit of JavaScript.

        <h2>About</h2>
        <p class="card-subtitle">A quick view of my background and how I like to work.</p>

        <p>
          I am a PLM techno-functional architect and business systems analyst with more than
          fourteen years of experience delivering PLM implementations and integrations across
          medical devices, hi-tech, aerospace, semiconductor, industrial equipment, consumer goods
          and healthcare.
        </p>

        <p>
          My core strengths are in Siemens Teamcenter, Oracle Agile PLM, PTC Windchill and
          MechWorks PDM, combined with hands-on integration work using T4X and T4O, Oracle
          Fusion Middleware, APIs and Power Platform. I design integration patterns that connect PLM
          with ERP systems such as Oracle EBS, Syspro, SAP and Microsoft Dynamics, as well as ALM,
          MES and QMS platforms.
        </p>

        <p>
          I enjoy working in the space between business and IT. I run workshops, clarify requirements,
          perform fit gap analysis and then work with technical teams to make sure solutions are practical,
          testable and supportable. I like simplifying complex landscapes and aligning tools, data and
          processes so teams can focus on delivery instead of constantly firefighting integrations.
        </p>

        <p>
          Outside work I enjoy travelling and following sports. Both influence how I think about teamwork,
          resilience and continuous improvement when I work with cross functional and global teams.
